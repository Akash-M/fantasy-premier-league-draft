We are preparing an analysis to help us prepare for a fantasy premier league draft game.

--------------
The game rules are as follows:
You will draft a squad of 15 players in the following positions:

2 Goalkeepers
5 Defenders
5 Midfielders
3 Forwards
Each Premier League player can only be in one manager's squad in your league.

Pre Draft
Before the draft takes place you are able to create a priority watchlist of players. This list can help quickly
identify potential picks during the draft and will also be used to automatically draft a player if you aren't
available to participate.

Draft Start
The draft will automatically start at the designated time if the minimum number of teams has been met. A random order
will be generated which will "snake" from round to round during the 15 rounds of the draft. In a snake draft the pick
order is reversed each round, for example:

Round 1: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D
Round 2: Team D, Team C, Team B, Team A
Round 3: Team A, Team B, Team C, Team D
Round 4: Team D, Team C, Team B, Team A
etc...
During The Draft
Depending on private league settings, you will be given between 30 and 120 seconds (default 90) to pick a player for
your squad. If you fail to pick a player within the time limit then the following criteria will be used to make an
automatic pick:

Select the highest priority player from your watchlist who is both available and in a position you still require.
Select the highest ranked available player in the draft list in a position you still require.
If an automatic pick is made then you will be marked as being offline and picks will be automatically made in
subsequent rounds. You can mark yourself online again in the draft room to resume manual drafting.

In the premier-league-all-stats.json files, we have player data from the 2024/2025 season. Let's make use of the
historical data to create a watchlist of players that we can use for the draft.

Below is the context regarding what each property in the player entries means:
- name: name of the player
- positionText: the position the player played in last season
- age: age of the player (remember that for this season, we would have to increment it by 1)
- teamName: the name of the team the player played
- rating: average rating of how well the player performed in the season based on analysis done by experts
- minsPlayed: total minutes played by the player in the season
- playedPositions: some players play in multiple positions, this is a list of all the positions they played in
- apps: total number of appearances made by the player in the season
- subOn: total number of times the player was substituted on
- goal: number of goals scored by the player
- totalShots: total number of shots taken by the player in the season
- xG: expected goals, a metric that estimates the quality of chances a player had
- xGDiff: expected goals difference, which is the difference between expected goals and actual goals scored
- xGPerNinety: expected goals per ninety minutes played, a measure of scoring efficiency
- xGPerShot: expected goals per shot taken, another measure of scoring efficiency

Expected outcome:

We would like to have the analysis.md file with the following information:
- we would like to have a watchlist of players that we can use for the draft
- we should create 3 groups based on the positionText of the players:
  - Goalkeepers
  - Defenders
  - Midfielders
  - Forwards
- separate each group by a separator line
- for each group, we should sort the players based on the following criteria:
  - rating (descending)
  - minsPlayed (descending)
  - minsPlayed (descending)
  - apps (descending)
  - subOn (ascending)
  - goal (descending)
  - totalShots (descending)
  - xG (descending)
  - xGDiff (descending)
  - xGPerNinety (descending)
  - xGPerShot
